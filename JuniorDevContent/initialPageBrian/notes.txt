    /________________\
    


option 2:
	theme : relateability
	8-bit font - does not necessarily reflect board games but
	from the perspective of it being tied to games in general
	and for possible expansion to the site being used for 
	hosting lan parties/video game meet ups; and it's also retro 
	tech looking so i guess integrating board game with technology
	monopoly color palette - use the color palette for a well
	known game to provide subtle familiarity

submit button for zipcode search - use the dice image to act as
button function instead of traditional button /or use 8-bit button
